The interface is modern and consistent, designed to highlight my skills, projects, and professional experience.\nThe website is optimized for both technical and semantic SEO: it uses structured tags, localized dynamic metadata (title, description, canonical, hreflang), supports Twitter Cards and Open Graph for effective social sharing, and implements a multilingual sitemap and a custom robots.txt file. It follows Google's mobile-first indexing guidelines and accessibility best practices."
