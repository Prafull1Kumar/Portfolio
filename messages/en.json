      "description": "During my time at the University of Milan (Unimi), I pursued a Bachelor\\'s degree in Computer Science, developing a solid foundation in key areas of the field such as algorithms, data structures, programming, operating systems, and databases. Alongside my studies, I worked full-time, which limited the time I could fully dedicate to university. As a result, I decided to pause my studies to focus on my professional growth and career development. This decision allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in software development, which has been instrumental in shaping my technical skills.",

On the other hand, I also gained experience with newer technologies such as Android Jetpack, Kotlin, MVVM, LiveData, Room, and Retrofit, working on more innovative solutions. Additionally, I was responsible for implementing both UI and non-UI tests (including unit tests and integration tests), ensuring the quality and reliability of the applications we developed.",

This role taught me how to handle large-scale projects independently, requiring strong problem-solving and project management skills.
